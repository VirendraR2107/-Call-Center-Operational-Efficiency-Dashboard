# Call-Center-Operational-Efficiency-Dashboard

## Overview

This project presents a Power BI dashboard designed to analyze and visualize key metrics related to a customer service call center, including agent performance, IVR interactions, and escalation trends. The data is sourced from a MySQL database and analyzed through Power BI, running on an AWS EC2 instance for performance efficiency.

## Home

The **Home** page serves as the entry point of the dashboard. It includes:

- A small logo and clean layout.
- Visuals:
  - **Donut chart**: Call status (e.g., Resolved, Dropped, Escalated).
  - **Bar chart**: Total calls by agent.
  - **Line chart**: Total calls over months.
  - **KPI cards**:
    - Total calls
    - Average call duration
    - Drop rate %
    - Escalation rate %
    - Resolved rate %
- Interactive elements:
  - Slicers: Team, Date Range, Call Status.
  - Navigation buttons for easy access to all pages.

## Agent Performance

This page is focused on evaluating **individual agent performance**. It includes:

- **Line charts**: 
  - Average call duration by agent.
  - Escalation rate by agent.
- **Bar chart**: Total calls handled by agent.
- **Custom table**: Summarized data with key metrics.
- **Column chart**: Call status categorized by Agent ID.
- **KPI card**: Number of active agents.
- **Slicers**: Shift Timing, Teams, Call Status.

---

## IVR Interaction Behavior

The **IVR Interaction** page provides insights into how customers interact with the IVR system:

- **Line chart**: Dropped call % by day ‚Äî helps identify IVR efficiency.
- **Pie chart**: Call disposition count by category.
- **Column chart**: Call duration by IVR path ‚Äî identifies commonly asked queries.
- **Slicers**: Team, Date Range, Call Status.

This page helps in understanding:
- Whether calls were resolved without human interaction.
- How efficient and intuitive the IVR path is.
- Need for additional IVR options or improvements.

---

## Escalation

The **Escalation** page analyzes the cases that were not resolved initially and had to be escalated:

- **Bar chart**: Escalated vs Total calls by team.
- **Table**: Filterable by agent for deeper insights.
- **Slicers**: Same as previous pages (Team, Date, Status).

Key observations:
- Escalated call rate ~20% ‚Äî not critical, but improvement is needed.
- Escalation data can be used to add options to IVR or improve agent training.
- Drop rate (23%) is high ‚Äî worth investigating further.

---

## Findings

- **Call Drop Rate**: Around 23‚Äì24% ‚Äî potentially due to IVR resolution or technical issues. Needs to be reduced to below 10%.
- **Resolved Call Rate**: Too low ‚Äî should be consistently above 50%.
- **Escalation Rate**: Acceptable at 20%, but improvements could still be made.
- **Monthly Trend**: June showed fewer calls than May ‚Äî could indicate a need for improved sales efforts.
- **Call Volume by Agent**: Evenly distributed, since the IVR connects calls automatically.
- **Customer Patterns**: Call paths and durations indicate frequently asked questions ‚Äî good for building self-help resources.

---

## Infrastructure

- **Environment**: AWS EC2 instance (Windows OS via RDP) used for running Power BI.
- **Reason**: High computing power requirement ‚Äî local laptop is insufficient.
- **AWS Services Used**:
  - **EC2**: Hosting Power BI.
- **Database**: MySQL
  .- Initial SQL queries helped understand data structure.
  - Two tables linked via primary key.
- **Data**: Recent 1,000 IVR call records.

---

## Conclusion

This Power BI project helps stakeholders understand performance at multiple levels ‚Äî from individual agents to system-wide IVR efficiency. With clear visuals and interactivity, it allows data-driven decisions for improving customer service operations.

## üôè Special Thanks

Special thanks to **AWS** for providing $300 in credits, which allowed me to explore their cloud services in depth. This support helped me focus on AWS data analytics tools such as:

- **Glue**
- **Lambda**
- **Athena**
- **Redshift**
- **S3**

I primarily used **EC2** to run high-performance Power BI workloads that my local system couldn't handle efficiently.
